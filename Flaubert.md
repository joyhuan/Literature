# Gustave Flaubert 慈悲
A great French 19th century novelist.

The below script comes from [TheSchoolofLife](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XK8lZO39T-0&list=PLwxNMb28Xmpfv2COuuJaKzy6E2n8nSMdi&index=4).

Flaubert means huge to me personally. I will definitely write something about him when I'm more 
prepared for this important task in the future. 

1.	He understood the purpose of tragedy 

    a)	Flaubert wrote arguably the single greatest tragic novel ever written, *Madame Bovary*, which he worked on for five years and published in 1857. 
    
    b)	The point of a tragedy is to allow us to experience a degree of sympathy for others’ failures that’s so much greater than what we ordinarily feel.
    
    c)	It shakes us from our customary moralism and brittle superiority.
    
    d)	It helps us empathize in the way the modern media usually prevents.
    
    e)	Her life ceased to bear the dimensions of a black and white morality tale. Readers of the novel saw how easy it is to have a thoroughly miserable marriage without being in any way a bad person. Flaubert’s novel shows us the tensions and travails of married life without ever really taking sides.
    
    f)	They would not be in a mood to judge. All they’d be able to feel was pity, the cruelty and senselessness of life.
    
    g)	Flaubert seemed almost deliberately to enjoy unsettling the desire to find easy answers. No sooner had he presented Emma in a positive light than he would undercut her with an ironic remark. But then, just as readers were losing patience with her, he would draw them back to her, would tell them something about her sensitivity that would bring tears in the eyes. 
    
    h)	We end Flaubert’s novel with fear and sadness that how we’ve been made to live before we begin to know how, that how limited our understanding of ourselves and others is, that how great and catastrophic are the consequences of our actions, that how pitiless and vengeful the upstanding members of the community can be in response to our errors.
    
    i)	Tragedy inspires us to abandon ordinary life’s simplified, judgmental perspective on failure and defeat, rendering as generous towards the foolishness and errors that are endemic to our nature.
2.	What We Read Matters

    a)	Flaubert tells us in no uncertain terms that the reason Emma Bovary grew so dissatisfied unfairly so, with marriage, and therefore embarked on her disastrous affairs was because of the books she had read.
3.	The Stupidity of Modern Media 

    a)	Newspaper was spreading ‘la betise’ (stupidity) into every corner of France
    
    b)	Idiocy wasn’t the same as ignorance for Flaubert because it was compatible with knowing a lot of things, it just meant understanding nothing. 
4.	A Hatred of the French Bourgeoisie 

    a)	For Flaubert, the French bourgeoisie could be a repository of the most extreme prudery, snobbery, smugness, racism and pomposity. 
    
    b)	“It’s strange how the most banal utterances of the bourgeoisie sometimes make me marvel” he once complained in stifled rage, “there are gestures, sounds of people’s voices that I just can’t get over, silly remarks that almost give me vertigo, the bourgeoisie is for me something unfathomable.”
    
    c)	Flaubert wrote that he had nothing but disdain for this good civilization that prided itself on having produced railways, poisons, cream tarts, royalty and the guillotine.
    
    d)	What Flaubert hated above all was pomposity. Quote: “What stops me from taking myself seriously, even though I’m essentially a serious person, is that I find myself extremely ridiculous, not the kind of small-scale ridiculousness of slapstick comedy, but rather a ridiculousness that seems intrinsic to human life and manifests itself in the simplest actions and most ordinary gestures. For example, I can never shave without starting to laugh, it seems to idiotic. All this is very difficult to explain.”
    
    e)	“I am a soul brother to everything that lives, to the giraffe and to the crocodile as much as to the man.”
    
    f)	Foreside from hating a lot about his country, Flaubert also captures some of its best and wisest sides. We should read him for his earthiness, his humanity, his frankness and above all else his generosity of spirit. 
    
    g)	At the age of 17, in a somewhat melodramatic mood Flaubert wrote “Art is superior to everything, a book of poetry is worth more than a railway.”
